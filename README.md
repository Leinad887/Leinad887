ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!
ðŸ˜ƒ My name is Daniel Orcesi, also known as Leinad.
 - I'm a Brazilian teenager who loves programming.
 - I've been programming since I was a child, I started with block programming, and now I'm starting with 3D engines, HTML and Python.
 - I can understand things quickly and I have ease with logic, so I can create things with any tools (I've done games inside games)
